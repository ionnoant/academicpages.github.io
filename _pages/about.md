In my spare time I enjoy playing video games, going on lengthy camping trips, playing dodgeball, and fooling around with interesting datasets and writing blog posts. I currently work within the energy industry, using data to develop, inform, and assess energy policies within the Province of Ontario.

I graduated with a Masterâ€™s degree in Economics from the University of Toronto, where I specialized in Applied Econometrics.
