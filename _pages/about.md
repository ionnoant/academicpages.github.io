In my spare time I enjoy going on camping trips, skiing, playing dodgeball, and telling stories with interesting datasets. I currently work within the energy industry, using data to develop and assess energy policies within Ontario.

I graduated with a Masterâ€™s degree in Economics from the University of Toronto, where I specialized in Applied Econometrics. I am now working towards a second Master's degree in Data Science and Analytics at Ryerson University.
